As a first post, I chose to write about why I started this blog. This will help me come back to it and give me a reason to not give up.

I have always felt the need to write about tech, to write about my discoveries as a software engineer. 
I want to share my findings and maybe discuss them with my fellow software development addicts.
I love technology, it's what I do for a living, it's what I do on my free time. 

What pulls me towards tech is that it makes my brain actively thinking. 
At the end of the day, I feel like I didn't waste my time and I learned something new.

### Writing about stuff I like

Like I said, I really like doing tech stuff and I want to be a better developer.
I want to use this blog as a force pushing me to share what I know, and dive deeper into subjects I like so that I can fully understand and explain the inner workings of things.

I have many side projects under my belt, 99% of them goes unfinished. 
I will use this platform as a tool to talk about the stuff I do so it can at least help other developers, and it will serve me as a personal journal.

### Becoming a better writer

As software engineers, we spend most of our time thinking about a solution or doing project management stuff like creating issues on Jira, sending emails to coordinate with other teams, taking notes in our technical meeting or writing documentation.

We actually write a lot ! But a blog post is not an outline of a meeting or a description under a screenshot. 
It needs good structure, key points and some narrative to link all the components together.

All of this plays in making me _hopefully_ a better writer.

## Conclusion

I hope this will work well and that I will make of this a habit. 
The optimal result would be that the contents of this blog will provide knowledge and benefits to the readers.

If it's not the case this can only benefit me. So it's a win-win situation.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
